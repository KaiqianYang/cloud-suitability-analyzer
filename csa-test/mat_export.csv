4,config-encryption,CLOUD BLOCKER,Configuration Encryption,SECURITY,Use of encrypted sections is problematic in cloud environments. Configurations should be externalized as environment variables instead of encrypting them in configuration file.
5,config-sessionState,CLOUD BLOCKER,Stafeful Application,STATEFUL,"App should be executed as a stateless process. User session information could be store in the database (Ex https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/configure-sql-server-session-state-in-asp-net-core/). A better approach is to use a Redis or SQL Server distributed cache, which doesn't require sticky sessions. For more information, see Distributed caching in ASP.NET Core (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/distributed?view=aspnetcore-7.0)."
9,dotnet-FileCacheModule,CLOUD BLOCKER,File caching IIS module,STATEFUL,"Caching should be managed externally. Relying on IIS Modules won't work in Linux environment. Alternatives are distributed cache solutions like Redis, SQL Server distributed cache, NCache distributed cache."

24,js-fileIO,CLOUD BLOCKER,Javascript File IO,STATEFUL,"Cloud-native applications should not rely on a local filesystem to store information, configuration or logs. Some alternatives could be cloud storage (buckets), storing data in a shared database or leveraging shared mounted volumes in a kubernetes like environment."
